# legacy-android-projects

This repo contains a few android applications that I've made during the end of high school and start of university. They are scattered around all over the place and most of them were in private repos in my old Github account, which I lost the password to. Thankfully, some of the projects I do have .apk files and full documentation that they actually exist through a online app store that I used when I was in high school. 

Below is a table of all the applications I've developed in the past uploaded to this platform (CoolApk).

## Speedometer
Speedometer was the most ambitious project that I took on at the time being a relative newbie at Android. It is a program basically turning your old phone into a trip tracker and live speedometer for your bicycle or e-bike. I uploaded it and many people used it and they were happy that something like this existed. I got over 700 downloads.
